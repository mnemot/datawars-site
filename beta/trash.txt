How to make your own card game from trash you found lying around.

You'll need:

* A notebook and a pen. I use one of those A4-size notepads with .5mm squares on 'em. No idea what they're actually called elsewhere, but I know them a Cuadriculado or de Matemáticas. You'll use these a lot not only to
* A whole bunch of paper. The more stacks, the better. I'd recommend you use something thicker than the ones you'd find in office supplies.
* A lot of glue. I use Cola Fría, which I guess you'd call Elmer's Glue? Is that the white glue that you use in school? I'd recommend you also get a wide, sturdy brush, or a plastic blade to spread the glue on the paper.

Fortunately, all of this is stuff you can find in the trash, if you know where to look. I still have surplus stock of very sturdy yellowish sheets of A4 miscuts that I use regularly for everything from prototyping to cleaning the brush. In my area, the places I'd look for these kind of things would be near commercial neighborhoods with workshops that are constantly printing out stuff, around art and design schools, and also the "hip" neighborhoods wth artists who may mess up trimming paper for making something,

* A xerox machine
