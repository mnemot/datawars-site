		<h1>.DAEMON Card</h1>
		<p>Daemon cards. Similar to .PRG cards, these cards stay in game, but unlike .PRG cards, only one can be in play on each userâ€™s desktop, and they enter and stay in Idle state, even after executing commands. You can discard these cards from your desktop during your Setup phase.</p>
