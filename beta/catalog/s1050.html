			<h3>Gameplay Tip</h3>
			<p>This card can pretty much halt the entire game unless an opponent finds a way to target either the .PRG card or this card itself to put it out of game. The game will immediately resume after you choose to execute any command of any card in game, so it can be also used offensively.</p>
