				<h2>Design tips</h2>
				<p>This game takes very little to completely break, since the whole no-rarity philosophy behind its design doesn't restrict in any way the existence of a card so powerful no other card can destroy it, making this game prone to power creep in some fashion. However, to avoid power creep, the way I design cards follows these principles (alongside common sense, of course)</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Each card should be in some way unique. Try to avoid functional clones, or cards with functionality that is somewhat covered by another, existing card within your set. Keep in mind that if you're expanding over an already existing set, this rule also applies to cards that already exist on that set!</li>
					<li>Each card should have a clear objective. This one's very subjective, but the bottom line is that you don't want to make jack of all trades cards. If combining two things sounds like more than just a good idea then go for it.</li>
					<li>Card sets should have low card count. It's okay if the whole set with three expansion sets is shy of 200 cards. While other card games tend to have expansions that on their own round the three digits, the two previous points allow for card sets to be small. Feel free to completely change around the game feel with your card set! The idea behind card sets is that each set feels like its own experience.</li>
					<li>Clearly define your set's ideas an mechanics. If you're going to make a set that rely on very specific game mechanics, make it obvious so a lot of the game flow has something to do with them. For example, if your set uses tokens over cards, make it so a lot of cards have special conditions if tokens are over them. Avoid implementing mechanics that you won't revisit outside of a few cards.</li>
					<li>Avoid very high-power cards. No "win the game if..." cards, no "destroy anything at any moment". Since cards should have clear objectives, it's better if those objectives align with your set's ideas and mechanics.</li>
					<li>Feel free to make card-specific combos! The whole point of the no-rarity system is so anyone can have any copy of any card the amount of times they can print it, so very specific card combos can be used to create build-up to putting certain cards in play. I'm actually planning on including that as a mechanic in a later expansion set, so stay tuned if that sounds like a fun idea!</li>
					<li>If you're going to borrow someone else's card, make sure you're complying with the license those cards are distributed under.</li>
					<li>If you want to print your cards and don't want to hassle with Inkscape</li>
					<li>If you're planning on distributing your ruleset on a booklet, try using something like <a href="https://www.scribus.net/">Scribus</a> to layout your manual. Feel free to use the Instruction Booklet available on the 'Print' page as a template!</li>
