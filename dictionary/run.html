		<h1>Run Step</h1>
		<p>The Run step is the fourth phase within a turn. It is preceded by the Setup step.</p>
		<p>At this point, the current user can issue commands from idle .PRG and .DAEMON cards in play, as long as have either control or ownership of the card, alongside .SCRIPT cards from their hand. During this step, other users can also execute commands, always starting from current user in a stack-like fashion (last commands to be executed are the first to be resolved).</p>
