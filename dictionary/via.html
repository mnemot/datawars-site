		<p>Every time you <a href="index.html?term=issuing">issue a command</a> that a card can <a href="index.html?term=execution">execute</a>, is that card who executes the <a href="index.html?term=commands">command</a>, hence why you’re executing a command via a card. Sometimes a card may specify that you can execute a command present in another card via this card. This means that the command, even though is present in a different card, is considered to be executed via the card you’re executing the command.</p>
