		<h1>Command Execution</h1>
		<p>Cards have their effects printed on them, but certain effects must be manually triggered to execute. These are called commands, and are shown as specific entries within the card’s body of text in between {curly braces} indicating the Base Memory Cost of the command with symbols. The &#x25a0; symbol indicates a Memory Point to allocate, while a &#x25a1; symbol is meant to indicate a variable amount of Memory Points to allocate, as indicated by the command’s effects and/or requirements.</p>
		<p>You can only issue commands via cards in an Idle state, and only once any prerequisites have been fulfilled and Memory Points have been allocated the command is considered to be executed.</p>
