		<h1>Command Execution</h1>
		<p>Cards have their rules and functions printed on them, but certain actions must be manually triggered to execute. These are called commands, and are shown as specific entries within the card’s body of text in between {curly braces} indicating the <a href="index.html?term=basememory">Base Memory Cost</a> of the command with symbols. The &#x25a0; symbol indicates a <a href="index.html?term=memorypoints">Memory Point</a> to allocate, while a &#x25a1; symbol is meant to indicate a variable amount of Memory Points to allocate, as indicated by the command’s effects and/or requirements.</p>
		<p>You can only issue commands via cards in an <a href="index.html?term=idle">Idle state</a>, and only once any prerequisites have been fulfilled and Memory Points have been allocated the command is considered to be executed.</p>
