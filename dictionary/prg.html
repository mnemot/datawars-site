		<h1>.PRG Card</h1>
		<p>Program cards (identified with a &#x25bc; symbol) enter in game directly on your Desktop and take a turn to load up, and can execute commands. These cards enter in Loading state, and return to Idle state on their Memory Cleanup step. The .PRG cards that execute commands enter into Running state, and can't execute more commands until they return back to Idle state.</p>
