		<h1>Exit Step</h1>
		<p>The Exit step is the last phase within a turn.</p>
		<p>At this point, the turn is over. If the current user has more than 5 cards in their hand, they must discard cards from their hand until they have just 5. If any user has no cards left in their drive, they are considered out of the game. The last user standing in game wins.</p>
