		<h1>Exit Step</h1>
		<p>The Exit step is the last phase within a turn.</p>
		<p>At this point, the turn is over. If the current <a href="index.html?term=user">user</a> has more than 5 cards in their hand, they must discard cards from their hand to their <a href="index.html?term=trashbin">trash bin</a> until they have just 5. If any user has no cards left in their <a href="index.html?term=drive">drive</a>, they are considered out of the game. The last user standing in game wins.</p>
