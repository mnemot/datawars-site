		<h1>Setup Step</h1>
		<p>The Setup step is the third phase within a turn. It is preceded by the Memory Cleanup step.</p>
		<p>During this step, the current user can play any kind of card on their desktop, allocating Memory Points as needed. If the current user runs out of Memory Points during this step, their turn goes straight into the EXIT step.</p>
