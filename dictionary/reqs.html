		<p>Sometimes, card commands and effects require you to fulfill certain conditions in order to be issued. This text is specified in cursive text, and unless the conditiones laid out in this text aren't fulfilled, commands and effects that concern these requirements are specified on the text itself, otherwise the commands and effects pertinent to the conditions either aren't issued or resolve on immediate halt.</p>
