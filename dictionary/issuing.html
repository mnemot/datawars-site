		<h1>Command Issuing</h1>
		<p>Commands can only be executed during the Run step of each turn, and the first command to be issued is always the one issued by whoever is playing their turn, at the start of their Run step. All users can issue commands during this step in a "stack-like" fashion starting by the current user.</p>
