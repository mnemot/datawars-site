		<h1>"The Convenience Rule"</h1>
		<p>If for any reason some card is not clear (i.e. "half" an amount results in a non-exact number, a card that halts on non-specified requirements, the rule specifies "either" two things without a specific way of clearly choosing, etc.) the game is "designed" around a convenience rule that specifies that these would resolve always in favor of whoever is issuing the command. So, numbers always round up, unless it's negative, in which case they round down, etc.</p>
