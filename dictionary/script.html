		<h1>.SCRIPT Card</h1>
		<p>Script cards (identified with a &#x25c9; symbol) can be played cards pretty much at any moment, as long as itâ€™s your turn or you already can issue commands. These cards execute immediately, and are not considered to be in play, but their effects apply on resolve as long as they aren't halted on execution.</p>
