		<h1>Memory Cleanup Step</h1>
		<p>The Memory Cleanup step is the second phase within a turn. It is preceded by the Init step.</p>
		<p>In this step, the current user deallocates the Memory Points used by their cards, and set all their .PRG cards in play to Idle state. From this point on, any .DAEMON, .CONF and .PRG cards in play on the current userâ€™s desktop are considered to be active.</p>
