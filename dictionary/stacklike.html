		<h1>"Stack-Like" Resolving</h1>
		<p><a href="index.html?term=commands">Commands</a> “pile up” in a stack-like fashion and <a href="index.html?term=resolve">resolve</a> from the last <a href="index.html?term=issuing">issued command</a> to the first one. So, for example, if you issue a command and an opponents issues another command in return, their command must be resolved before your command is able to resolve.</p>
